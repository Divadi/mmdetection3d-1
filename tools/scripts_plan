    Day 
        0) PointPillars baseline, 30x2 epochs on 1/5 data. Trained with batch size 3, FP16
        1) Fine-tune 1) 6x1 epochs on all data, start with 10x lower lr. Trained with batch size 3, FP16
4/19
    Overnight
        0) Run on KITTI, with voxel size 0.32 (similar to aiodrive run above)
4/21
    Overnight
        0) Same setup as 4/18 0), but without FP16
            Goal is to compare performance and see if FP16 hurt.
        1) Reduced pillar size to 0.16, 2D head is stride 2, decreased # pts in voxels

    Overnight
        0) SECOND, FP16
        1) 4/18 0), but with denselv1. reduced # points in each voxel to 64
